# OLA - Ensemble Learning
 This project tackles high driver churn at Ola by predicting driver attrition. Using ensemble techniques—bagging (Random Forest) and boosting (XGBoost)—along with KNN imputation, SMOTE, and standard scaling, we analyze demographic, tenure, and performance data to enable proactive retention strategies.
